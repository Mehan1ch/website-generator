Testing is a crucial task to ensure that the application functions now and in the future, according to the given requirements.
Even though testing doesn't ensure bug free code, it reduces the number of (unnoticed) bugs, and the chance of errors.
It also does not protect against logical errors or oversights.
I tested both the frontend and backend applications exhaustively.
The proxy application I opted not to test, as it is mostly a lightweight wrapper around the Kubernetes JavaScript client library, which itself is already well-tested by its creators and maintainers.
