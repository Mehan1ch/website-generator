\chapter{Architecture}

The goal of the thesis is to develop a template-driven website generator SaaS platform that allows users to create, customize, and publish single-page websites.
Special attention must be paid to scalability, security and user experience (UX).
A platform that can achieve this task from one end (the user) to the other (deployment) is inherently complex and requires the cooperation and integration of many technologies.
To begin with, I will present the overarching high-level architecture of the complete system, introduce each component, then explain the ways they integrate and interact in detail.

The architecture itself can be viewed on Figure \ref{fig:architecture}.
