# Frontend

A React frontend for the application, built with React, Tanstack Router, Tanstack Query and CraftJs.

---

## Running the frontend in development mode

- Prerequisites:
  - Node.js and npm or yarn installed.
  - Backend server running and accessible.
  - OpenAPI specification file generated by the backend (e.g., `api/v1.yaml`), should already be included.

- Steps:
    1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the variables.
    2. Generate the OpenAPI client using openapi-ts with
       `npm run openapi`
    3. Start the frontend:

       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```

       or with docker:

       ```bash
       docker-compose up -d
       ```

    4. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:5173`.
    5. Optionally run tests:

       ```bash
       npm run test
       ```
