# Website generator

Repository for my Computer Engineering Master's Thesis project titled:

## Tech Stack

Overview of some of the main technologies used in this project:

- Frontend: React, Tanstack Query and Router, React Hook Form, Schadcn UI

- Proxy app: Fastify, Kubernetes Js Client

## Architecture overview

- Under construction - will add a diagram here later.

## Running in development

- Please refer to the readme files in the folders of each application for instructions on how to run them in development mode.
- Since this was a master's thesis project, there is no production ready deployment setup provided, you would need to set that up yourself if you wish to deploy it.
